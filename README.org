* Overview

  This is the project about our JSHDR (CVPR2021).
  Our paper is here [[https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Fu_A_Multi-Task_Network_for_Joint_Specular_Highlight_Detection_and_Removal_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf][paper]].

  Figure 1: Visual comparison of highlight detection and removal on an
  example image from our dataset. We compare our method with the
  state-of-the-art removal method Shi /et al/. [7], Guo /et al/. [6],
  and Yang /et al/ [3], and with the state-of-the-art detection methods
  including Zhang /et al/. [2], Li /et al/ [1], and Fu /et al/ [8].
  Please zoom in to view fine details.

  Specular highlight detection and removal are fundamental and
  challenging tasks. Although recent methods have achieved promising
  results on the two tasks by training on synthetic training data in a
  supervised manner, they are typically solely designed for highlight
  detection or removal, and their performance usually deteriorates
  significantly on real-world images. In this paper, we present a
  novel network that aims to detect and remove highlights from natural
  images. To remove the domain gap between synthetic training samples
  and real test images, and support the investigation of
  learning-based approaches, we first introduce a dataset with about
  16K real images, each of which has the corresponding ground truths
  of highlight detection and removal. Using the presented dataset, we
  develop a multi-task network for joint highlight detection and
  removal, based on a new specular highlight image formation model.
  Experiments on the benchmark datasets and our new dataset show that
  our approach clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both
  highlight detection and removal.

* Specular highlight image quadruples (SHIQ)

  To enable effective training and comprehensive evaluation for
  highlight detection and removal, we in this work introduce a
  large-scale real dataset for highlight detection and removal. It
  covers a wide range of scenes, subjects, and lighting conditions.
  Each image in the dataset has the corresponding highlight detection,
  removal, and highlight intensity images. Several examples in our
  dataset are shown in Figure 2.

  highlight-free (*2nd row*), highlight intensity (*3rd row*) and
  highlight mask (*4th row*) image quadruples in our dataset.

  Some notes about the data generation as follows:
  - The original multi-illumination dataset can be downloaded from
    [[https://projects.csail.mit.edu/illumination/][Lukas Murmann's homepage]].
  - The original multi-image specular reflection removal method RPCA
    can also be available from [[https://sites.google.com/view/xjguo/homepage][xjguo]].
  - We provide the useful source code which can produce the data
    including =image cropping=, =data augmentation=, =mask generation= and
    =white balance operation= /etc/.
  - You can download our data from Google Drive. The link is:

  - *Statement*. SHIQ dataset is intended only for research purposes and
    thus cannot be used commercially. Moreover, reference must be made
    to the following publication when the dataset is used in any academic
    and research reports.
